            <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
            <p>This is a little bio about me!</p>
            <p>My name is Okaeme Felicity Uju, I'm a student of the University Of Lagos, studying Business Administration. I picked up an interest in Tech and I'm going to be talking about this amazing Community called ALX.</p>

            <p>ALX Africa is a community dedicated to equipping and empowering Africans with various tech skills to solve the global shortage of tech talent by making available access to world-class tech trainings. </p>

            <h3>Tech Specialization Track</h3>
            <p>I'm currently signed up on a tech programme with this amazing community and my tech specialization track is Front-End Development, this has to do with the user side of web and its design and layout, so far I haven't experienced any difficulty in the program and I pledge that however things get, I will stick to it till the very end and will be graduating this program successfully, becoming a certified Front-End Web Developer!</p>
